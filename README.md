# Restaurant_Recommendation
• Used the k means machine learning algorithm to generate a recommendation using the user’s history of restaurant ratings
• Created a linear regression algorithm to give the user a better recommendation rather than just using clusters 
• Integrated function and data abstractions methods for code size reduction and better abstraction of Yelp’s dataset
